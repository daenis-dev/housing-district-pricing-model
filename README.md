# Getting Started

- Install *virtualenv* if it isn't already installed

  ```
  >> py -m pip install --user -U virtualenv
  ```

- Create a virtual environment

  ```
  >> py -m virtualenv env
  ```

- Use Pip to install the required libraries

  ```
  >> py -m pip install -u jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn
  ```

  - This will need to be done along the way with additional libraries

- Open a Jupyter notebook and run the commands in the file *analyze_and_train.ipynb*

  ```
  >> jupyter notebook
  ```
